Meet the Lifecycle Methods
Lifecycle methods are not very complicated. We can think of them as glorified event handlers 
that get called at various points in a component’s life, and just like event handlers, you can 
write some code to do things at those various points. Before we go further, it is time for you to 
quickly meet our lifecycle methods. They are:

 ■ componentWillMount
 ■ componentDidMount
 ■ componentWillUnmount
 ■ componentWillUpdate
 ■ componentDidUpdate
 ■ shouldComponentUpdate
 ■ componentWillReceiveProps

 We aren’t quite done yet. There are three more methods that we are going to throw into the 
mix even though they aren’t strictly lifecycle methods, and they are:
 ■ getInitialState
 ■ getDefaultProps
 ■ render
Some of these names probably sound familiar to you, and some you are probably seeing for the 
first time. Don’t worry. By the end of all this, you’ll be on a first name basis with all of them! 
What we are going to do is look at these lifecycle methods from various angles—starting with 
some code!
